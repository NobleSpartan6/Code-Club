# Why donate?
By supporting Lakeville North Code Club, you are benefiting a large group of students grades 9-12.

# Where does the money go?
All donations are put into the school code club bank account. This money will then be used for various things such as textbooks, online resources, and daily meeting expenses like snacks. If you would like your donation to put towards something in particular, either leave that message when you donate, or send an email to *mjomdal@gmail.com*

## Identifiers ##

In java, an identifier is the name you give to any variable:

```java

int bigNumber = 10235908;

```

here, the identifier of this variable is bigNumber, because that is the name associated with the value

- keywords are not allowed as Identifiers (i.e. you cant name your variable 'class')
- multi-word Identifiers should be formatted either in camel case or with underscores. There can be no spaces.

```java

String itsMyBirthday = "March 28, 2000";
String its_My_Birthday = "April 9, 1997";

```

- never start an identifier with anything other than a letters
- the first letter should always be capitalized
- identifiers are case-sensitive

```java

int bigNumber = 100;
// is not the same as:
int bignumber = 100;

```

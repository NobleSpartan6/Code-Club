## Fido is making chocolate bone treats for the holidays!
He is going to need some help writing some code to count how many chocolate bars he can make with a certain amount of chocolate
- For every 117 grams of chocolate, Fido can make one chocolate treat
Write a function that takes number of grams of chocolate as an input, and returns the number of treats he can make with the amount of chocolate he has.

```java
public class Treats {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // call function here
  }

  public static int calculateBones(int gramsOfChocolate) {
    // Do something here
  }
}
```

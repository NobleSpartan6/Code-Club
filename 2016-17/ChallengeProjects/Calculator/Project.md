![calulator](../../GIFS/calculator_demo.gif "claculator")

##### Calculators are used a lot! and in order to make one you need to understand the basics of how graphical user interfaces work #####
- Using the java Swing interface, build a calculator that can be used to calculate basic functions like +,-,รท, and โข
- For help on Graphical User Interfaces, check the BigJava/Graphical User Interfaces folder
- The internet is your friend, this project won't be easy
- This project is intentionally more open-ended than most. It is to test how well you can uncover new skills on your own

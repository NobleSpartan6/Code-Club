    I have ran Cross Country for six years. On the team, I have found some of my best friends. The reason I love running so much is because the people who join are so passionate about the sport.

    I started computer programming in middle school. The first line of code I wrote flashed an LED on and off. From there, I have continued to learn to make all sorts of interesting things
